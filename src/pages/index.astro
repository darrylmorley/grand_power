            If you visit GRAND POWER in Banská Bystrica – Slovenská Ľupča today, you will
            find that it is a well-equipped and prosperous company employing over 100
            people. However, none of this would be true if its founder and owner, Mr.
            Jaroslav Kuracina, was not smart and stubborn.

            He got his passion for weapons from his grandfather who was a partisan during
            the WWII. His grandpa was also a hunter; he had a lot of weapons and he used
            to take his grandchild to a shooting range.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden lg:block">
            Weapons became Jaro´s hobby. He drew his first weapon as a teenager. He
            continued with his drawing while studying at the Military School. His
            colleagues used to call him “Piccaso”. He told his superior the people would
            use his guns one day. Instead of encouragement, he only heard sarcastic
            comments like: “Hell will freeze over first before they do so”. However, the
            young soldier was not put off by this. His first serious sketches date back to
            1994. Just three years later the first functional prototype, marked Q200 with
            serial number E001, was made in Kinex Grand – a subsidiary of Kinex Bytča.
